### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an enhancement suggestion, please include:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title**
- **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement**
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**
- **Describe the current behavior and explain the behavior you expected**
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful**

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

- **Beginner issues** - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two
- **Help wanted issues** - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- CMake 3.21 or higher
- C compiler with C17 support (GCC 8+, Clang 9+, MSVC 2019+)
- Conan package manager
- Python 3.6+ (for Conan)
- Git

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/App.git
   cd App
   ```
3. **Set up the development environment**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/project.sh setup
   ```
4. **Create a topic branch** from main:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
   ```

### Building and Testing

```bash
# Build the project
./scripts/project.sh build

# Run tests
./scripts/project.sh test

# Run all quality checks
./scripts/project.sh format
./scripts/project.sh lint
./scripts/project.sh coverage
```

## Style Guidelines

### C Code Style

We use Clang Format for consistent code formatting. The configuration is in `.clang-format`.

**Key style points:**
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Line length limit of 100 characters
- Linux-style braces
- Function and variable names in `snake_case`
- Constants and macros in `UPPER_CASE`
- Comprehensive documentation with Doxygen comments

**Example:**
```c
/**
 * @brief Adds two integers
 * 
 * @param a First integer
 * @param b Second integer
 * @return The sum of a and b
 */
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

**Format:**
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

### Documentation

- All public functions must have Doxygen documentation
- Include examples in documentation when helpful
- Update README.md if your changes affect usage
- Update CHANGELOG.md following the Keep a Changelog format
